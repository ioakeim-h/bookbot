# BookBot

BookBot is a simple command-line tool that analyzes a text file of a book to provide a word count and a detailed count of each alphabetic character’s occurrences. Given a file path as input, it reads the book’s contents, counts the total words, calculates character frequencies, sorts the characters by frequency, and prints a clear report summarizing these statistics. This tool is useful for basic text analysis and gaining insight into character distribution within a text.
